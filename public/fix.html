        which is limited to the execution of a specific Transaction.

      </li>
      <li>5. Applicable law prohibits money transmitters from doing business with certain individuals or countries;
        Money Transfer Service Provider is required to screen all Transactions against lists of names provided by the
        governments of the countries and territories in which Money Transfer Service Provider does business, including
        the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Contrul (OFAC) and the European Union. If a potential
        match is identified, Money Transfer Service Provider researches the Transaction to determine if the name matched
        is indeed the individual on the relevant list. For this purpose, Money Transfer Service Provider is entitled to
        request from the Client or the designated Receiver additional details and proof of identification which may
        cause the Transaction to be delayed. This is a legal requirement for all Transactions processed by Money
        Transfer Service Provider (including transfers that originate and terminate outside of the US)
      </li>
      <li> 6.Written information explaining how Money Transfer Service Provider charges the Client for making a money
        transfer is available on and is shown to the Client prior to completion of the Transaction. The Client shall
        bear all fees due to complete the money transfer unless applicable law in the destination country requires
        otherwise. Money transfers should be sent to a local (Receiver’s) currency, otherwise the receiving institution
        (where the Receiver has his or her account) may convert the funds at its own exchange rate or may even reject
        the money transfer.
      </li>
      <li>7.Money transfer payments will normally be made in the currency of the destination country (in some countries
        payment is available only in an alternative currency). All currency is converted at current rate of exchange.
        Money Transfer Service Provider calculates its rate of exchange based on commercially available interbank rates
        plus a margin. Most exchange rates are adjusted several times daily in line with the relevant closing rates of
        global financial markets.
      </li>
      <li>8. The currency will be converted at the time of the transfer and the Receiver will receive the foreign
        currency amount shown in this form. However, in some countries local regulations require money transfers to be
        converted only when they are paid out. If the Client is sending the funds to one of these countries, the
        exchange rate noted above is only an estimate, and the actual exchange rate will be determined at the time of
        payment. Payment Agent may offer Receivers the choice to receive funds in a currency different from the one the
        Client selected. In such instances, Money Transfer Service Provider (or its agents or account provider) may
        cullect additional money when they convert the Client’s funds into the currency selected by the Receiver. If the
        Client chooses a payment currency different from the national currency of the destination country, the payment
        currency chosen may not be available at all payment locations in that country, or may not be available in small
        enough denominations to pay all of the money transfer. In such cases, the Payment Agent may pay all or part of
        the Client’s money transfer in national currency. Money Transfer Service Provider’s exchange rate may be less
        favourable than some publicly reported commercial exchange rates used in transactions between banks or other
        financial institutions. Any difference between the currency exchange rate offered to customers and the currency
        exchange rate received by Money Transfer Service Provider will be kept by Money Transfer Service Provider (and,
        in some instances, its agents or account provider) in addition to the transfer fees.
